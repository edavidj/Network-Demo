# Vis-Network
**work in progress**<br>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
- Add Group will add specified number of nodes to the network, on the node you have selected.
- Delete will delete all child nodes of selected node.
- Clear all does exactly what it says.
- Double click is shortcut for adding groups.
<h2>Notes: </h2>
- This project was just to mess around with vis.js node module, as I needed to use it for a project at work. <br>
- vis.js file is not needed atm, only the vis-network.min.js file, I included it so bootstrap wouldn't turn the project label into CSS<br>
- Planning to turn into a more dedicated network generator in the future <br>
- Going to add label setting and editing features later on.<br>
