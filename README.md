# Vis-Network
**work in progress**<br>
<h2>What's this?</h2>
- This project was just to mess around with vis.js node module, as I needed to use it for a project at work. <br>
- Create, connect, and edit(soon tm) nodes within the network. <br>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
- Add Group will add specified number of nodes to the network, on the node you have selected.<br>
- Delete will delete all child nodes of selected node. <br>
- Clear all does exactly what it says. <br>
- Double click is shortcut for adding groups. <br>
<h2>Notes: </h2>
- Planning to turn into a more dedicated network generator in the future <br>
- Going to add label setting and editing features later on.<br>
