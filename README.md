# Vis-Network
**work in progress**
This project was just to mess around with vis.js node module, as I needed to use it for a project at work. 
vis.js file is not needed atm, only the vis-network.min.js file, I included it so bootstrap wouldn't turn the project label into CSS xD

Going to add label setting and editing features in a few days.
